    <p class= "blog__text">To put Sampark in a nutshell,
    We will be fulfilling two tasks:</p>
    <ol class= "list">
    <li class= "blog__text"> Health, sanitation and other requirements for the needy.</li>
    <li class= "blog__text"> Education for slum children.</li>
    </ol>
    <br/>
    
    <h3 class= "blog__subHead">How?</h3>
    <hr class= "underline"/>
    
    <h3 class= "blog__subHead">Task 1:</h3>
    <p class= "blog__text">Health,sanitation and other requirements for the needy
    The first step is data collection to be done by our volunteers visiting slum areas and collecting data about the requirements like general healthcare,hygiene,stationary items etc. with the required number of each item.This will be stored in the form of google spreadsheet which will be updated in firebase database then.
    In the second step, the NGOs/social welfare organisations will be getting the required items through the funds which will be collected by the Sampark website.
    The final step is distributing the items to the needy(may take help of nearest college team with item distribution).</p>
    
    <h3 class= "blog__subHead">Task 2:</h3>
    <p class= "blog__text"> Education for slum children Every alternate day, the nearest college team will be taking care of the classes for slum children.This can be done by taking the children to some safe and sound teaching environment, teaching them and then sending them home safely.With this, the college students will also be able to donate their old books to the needy children.
    College students will also be receiving rewards for the good work they will be doing.</p>

    <p class= "blog__text">We recently organized a cloth distribution event to help underprivileged individuals in the local community. The event was aimed at providing warm clothes to people who were unable to afford them, especially during the winter season. The initiative was a success, and it brought smiles to the faces of many individuals who were struggling to make ends meet. </p>
    </br>
  <h3 class= "blog__subHead">  Event Details:</h3>
    <p class= "blog__text">The cloth distribution event took place on 28/12/2022 at IET LUCKNOW, and it was open to all individuals who were in need of warm clothes. The event was publicized through social media, word of mouth, and flyers distributed in the community. Volunteers were present at the event to assist with the distribution of the clothes. The clothes were sorted by size and gender, and each individual was allowed to choose the clothes they needed.</p>
    
    <h3 class= "blog__subHead">Impact on the Community:</h3>
    <p class= "blog__text">The cloth distribution event had a significant impact on the community. Many individuals who attended the event were unable to afford warm clothes, and the event provided them with much-needed relief.</p></div>`,
